## Salmon Cookies

I build a web page for Patâ€™s Salmon Cookies,to calculate the number of cookies each location must make every day so that it can manage its supplies inventory and baking schedule. The number of cookies to make depends on the hours of operation (6:00 AM to 8:00 PM for all locations). Also I've made a form that allows the user to input new data for new shops and then show the calculated cookies for each hour for the added shop in the table.
